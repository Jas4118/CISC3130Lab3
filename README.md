# CISC3130Lab3
This repo has several files similar to Lab2 with the exception that I took out the artistName class since I decided not to check frequency as it was not asked of us. The main file that has the code is Lab3.java and I found that importing collections class gave me a very easy way of creating this.I found that I didn't need to change much from my Lab2 so I've basically placed all the unique names of artists in a HashSet called nameSet. Then for each artist in nameSet I would add an artist into my linked list called list and after I would sort it and print it out into the System.out and the output file called TopStreamingArtists.txt.
