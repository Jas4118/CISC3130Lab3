# CISC3130Lab3
This repo has several files similar to Lab2 with the exception that I took out the artistName class since I decided not to check frequency as it was not asked of us. I found that importing collections class gave me a very easy way of creating this. I've basically placed all the unique names of artists in a HashSet called nameSet. Then for each artist in nameSet I would add an artist into my linked list called list and after I would sort it with collections and print it out into the System.out and the output file called TopStreamingArtists.txt.
